Instructions:
- Always produce a single JSON object: {"score": X, "notes": "brief explanation", "breakdown": {"legitimacy": X, "completeness": X, "relevance": X}}
- Score range: 0-100. Keep notes concise and specific.
- ADMIN NOTES: If any admin notes present, score=0 (should not reach this point due to early exit)
- LOCATION: If no valid coordinates, score=0 and require manual review
- VEGAN-FRIENDLY: Accept venues with vegan options even if they serve meat. Only reject if NO vegan options exist.
- VENUE INCLUSION: All food-related venues (restaurants, cafes, stores, bakeries, juice bars) are acceptable if vegan-friendly
- LEGITIMACY: Base on data verification and Google presence, not trust level
- COMPLETENESS: Award points for available fields (name, address, phone, website, hours, coordinates)
- RELEVANCE: Assess vegan/vegetarian focus for HappyCow directory
- CLARITY: Explain specific missing elements, avoid vague terms like "lacks indicators"
- TRUST LEVEL: Only affects validation strictness, not legitimacy scoring
- DATA PRIORITY: Follow data priority guidance for conflicting information
- Use Combined Information if present; otherwise rely on Venue Information Data.
- Respond with JSON only, no extra text.
