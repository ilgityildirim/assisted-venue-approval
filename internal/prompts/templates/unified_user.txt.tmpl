You must score the venue and reply with JSON only.

Data:
- Combined Information (JSON): {{.CombinedJSON}}
- Venue Information Data (JSON): {{.VenueJSON}}
- Admin Note: {{.AdminNote}}
- Admin Hold Email Note: {{.AdminHoldEmailNote}}
- Google Business Status: {{.GoogleStatus}}
- Google Types: {{.GoogleTypes}}
- Venue Type Indicators: {"vegonly": {{.VegOnly}}, "vegan": {{.Vegan}}, "category": {{.Category}}}
- Trust Level (0.0-1.0): {{printf "%.2f" .TrustLevel}}

Instructions:
- Always produce a single JSON object: {"score": X, "notes": "brief", "breakdown": {"legitimacy": X, "completeness": X, "relevance": X}}
- Score range: 0-100. Keep notes concise.
- If admin_note or admin_hold_email_note indicates this venue should not be approved for ANY reason, set score=0 and explain briefly in notes (manual review).
- If Google business_status is provided and is not OPERATIONAL, set score=0 unless trust_level >= 0.80, and note why using notes.
- For type validation: Check if Google types are LOGICALLY compatible with food venues. Food venues should have at least one food-related type (restaurant, food, meal_takeaway, meal_delivery, cafe, bakery, bar, establishment, point_of_interest). Types like ["premise", "street_address"] alone or ["lodging", "travel_agency"] suggest non-food business. Only set score=0 for clear mismatches when trust_level < 0.80.
- Venue Type indicators (vegonly/vegan/category) suggest this should be a food-related venue.
- LEGITIMACY (35 points): Score based on data verification and completeness. If venue has Google-verified data (formatted address, coordinates, phone, business status), award 25-35 points regardless of trust_level. Trust level is for validation rules only, not legitimacy assessment. Missing or unverified data reduces legitimacy points.
- COMPLETENESS (30 points): Award points for available fields (name, address, phone, website, hours, coordinates).
- RELEVANCE (35 points): Assess how well this fits HappyCow directory (vegan/vegetarian focus).
- Use Combined Information if present; otherwise rely on Venue Information Data.
- TRUST LEVEL usage: Trust level should only affect strict validation rules (business status, type mismatches) but not prevent scoring legitimate venues with good Google verification.
- Consider venue description (can be empty) in relevance.
- Allocate points roughly: legitimacy 35, completeness 30, relevance 35.
- Respond with JSON only, no extra text.
