DESCRIPTION GUIDELINES:
{{.DescriptionGuidelines}}

NAME TRANSLATION GUIDELINES:
{{.NameGuidelines}}

Your task:
1. Rewrite the description to follow ALL guidelines perfectly
2. Fix the name format if incorrect (omit if already correct)
2.5. CRITICAL - DO NOT INVENT ANY INFORMATION:
  - NEVER add information not explicitly stated in the original text
  - Do NOT invent: features, offerings, menu items, attributes, facilities, or any other details
  - Do NOT make assumptions or guesses about the venue
  - Do NOT add "variety of" unless original mentions multiple items
  - ONLY state facts clearly present in the original description

2.6. REMOVE ALL SUBJECTIVE LANGUAGE (even if in original):
  - ALWAYS remove subjective opinions and promotional words:
    * Atmosphere: cozy, nice, charming, lovely, beautiful, inviting, welcoming, warm
    * Service: friendly (when describing staff/service), attentive, kind, helpful
    * Food: tasty, delicious, amazing, great, yummy, excellent, wonderful
    * Value: affordable, cheap, expensive, great price
  - EXCEPTION - Keep factual policy descriptors ONLY:
    * "dog-friendly", "pet-friendly" = dogs allowed (factual policy, not opinion)
    * "child-friendly", "cash-free", "non-smoking" = factual policies
  - Use neutral language: "serves", "offers", "includes", "located in"

2.7. HANDLING USER REVIEWS:
  - If text uses first person ("I", "my", "we"): Extract ONLY factual information
  - Remove ALL opinions and promotional language
  - Examples:
    * Input: "I found this cozy place nice, variety of tasty dishes!"
      Facts: None specific (no actual menu items mentioned)
      Output: Flag for manual review if insufficient factual information

    * Input: "Friendly cafe with delicious vegan burgers and amazing fries"
      Facts: serves vegan burgers and fries
      Output: "Café serving vegan burgers and fries."

    * Input: "Dog-friendly restaurant, loved their vegan tacos"
      Facts: dogs allowed, serves vegan tacos
      Output: "Dog-friendly restaurant serving vegan tacos."

3. IMPORTANT - "SERVES MEAT" PREFIX RULES (check VeganStatus field):

  ** IF VeganStatus is "Vegan": **
  - This is a 100% vegan venue
  - DO NOT add "Serves meat" or "Serves fish" to the description
  - EXCEPTION: If the user's description explicitly mentions meat/fish dishes (beef, pork, chicken, lamb, bacon, fish, seafood), then ADD "Serves meat, vegan options available, " - this indicates incorrect venue classification

  ** IF VeganStatus is "Vegetarian": **
  - This is a 100% vegetarian venue (no meat)
  - DO NOT add "Serves meat" to the description
  - If description mentions fish dishes, use "Serves fish, vegetarian options available, "
  - EXCEPTION: If description mentions meat dishes, ADD "Serves meat, vegetarian options available, " - this indicates incorrect classification

  ** IF VeganStatus is "Vegan Options": **
  - This venue serves meat/fish to non-vegans
  - Description MUST start with "Serves meat, vegan options available, " OR "Serves fish, vegan options available, "
  - Choose "Serves fish" only for pescatarian restaurants (no meat, only fish)

4. HOURS NOTE (CLOSED DAYS) GENERATION:
  CRITICAL - Read carefully to avoid false positives:

  A day is CLOSED ONLY if:
  - The day is completely MISSING from the Hours list, OR
  - The day explicitly states "Closed" in the Hours text

  A day is NOT closed if:
  - It has ANY operating hours listed (even if hours differ from other days)
  - Example: "Monday: 6:00 PM – 12:00 AM" means OPEN on Monday

  Common error to avoid:
  - If Hours shows: "Monday: 6:00 PM – 12:00 AM, Tuesday: 6:00 PM – 12:00 AM, Wednesday: 12:00 PM – 12:00 AM, ..."
  - This venue is OPEN all 7 days (just different hours) → omit closed_days field entirely

  Format for actual closed days:
    * Single day: "Closed Mon"
    * Two days: "Closed Sun & Mon"
    * Consecutive range: "Closed Mon-Wed"

  If venue is open 7 days/week OR hours unavailable: omit closed_days field entirely

5. PATH VALIDATION (if path provided):
  Format: continent|country|[state/region]|city
  - Use pipes (|) to separate hierarchy levels
  - Use underscores (_) for spaces: "hong_kong", "new_york", "south_africa"
  - All lowercase: "north_america|usa|california|los_angeles"
  - Valid continents: africa, asia, europe, north_america, south_america, oceania

  Examples:
  - asia|china|hong_kong|kowloon ✓
  - north_america|usa|california|san_francisco ✓
  - europe|germany|berlin ✓
  - africa|south_africa|johannesburg ✓

  Validation Checks:
  1. FORMAT: lowercase, pipes, underscores (not hyphens/spaces)
  2. HIERARCHY: continent → country → [region] → city
  3. GEOGRAPHIC MATCH: Path location must align with coordinates
     - Coordinates in China → path should start with asia|china
     - Coordinates in Brazil → path should start with south_america|brazil
     - Coordinates in Germany → path should start with europe|germany
  4. COMMON ERRORS: Wrong continent, wrong separators, typos

  Confidence Levels:
  - HIGH: Clear mismatch (europe|france with Tokyo coordinates)
  - MEDIUM: Neighboring country or border ambiguity
  - LOW: Format issues (capitals, hyphens instead of underscores)

  Notes:
  - Omit pathValidation entirely if no path provided
  - If path is valid, set isValid=true and omit issue field
  - If path has issues, set isValid=false and provide clear issue description
  - Omit pathValidation field entirely if no path provided
  - Omit pathValidation.issue field if path is valid

Output JSON only:
{
  "description": "rewritten description following all guidelines",
  "name": "corrected name format (omit this field entirely if name is already correct or your change is matching the original)",
  "closed_days": "Closed days note (omit this field entirely if no regular closed days)",
  "pathValidation": {
    "isValid": true/false,
    "issue": "description of problem (omit if valid)",
    "confidence": "high/medium/low"
  }
}
