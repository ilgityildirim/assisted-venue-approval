- If venue has ANY hours for a day, it's OPEN (even if different hours than other days)
- Format: "Closed Mon", "Closed Sun & Mon", "Closed Mon-Wed"
- If open 7 days or hours unavailable: omit closed_days field (set to null)

Return ONLY valid JSON:

  "description": "Rewritten description following ALL rules",

  "pathValidation": {
    "isValid": true/false,
    "issue": "Problem description (omit if valid)",

  }
}

========================================
