You must ABSOLUTELY NEVER include operating hours, open times, close times, or any time-related information in the description text.
Examples of what is FORBIDDEN in description:
- "Open daily from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM"
- "Opens at 9am"
- "Available Monday through Friday"
- "Open 24/7"
- Any mention of opening/closing times

Rewrite description following ALL guidelines perfectly.
Fix name format if wrong (omit name field if already correct).

Output JSON only.
